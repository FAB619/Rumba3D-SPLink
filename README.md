# Rumba3D-SPLink

**"Rumba SpLink"** is a catchy and descriptive name for a 3D printer board with ESP connectivity, LCD screen and TFT support, and compatibility with Marlin firmware and Klipper on Raspberry Pi.

The "Rumba SpLink" combines the familiar RUMBA board with the "ESP Link" module, which could stand for "Smart Printer Link" or "Serial Port Link," indicating the enhanced connectivity and communication capabilities of the board.

the RUMBA board enables users to control and monitor their 3D printers with ease. It conveys the idea of a smart and efficient link between different components, facilitating a smooth printing experience.

Rumba3D-Splink is a version of the RUMBA 3D Printer control board. Rumba3D-Splink is derived from the Aus3D RUMBA+ design and Rumba32 design, which is an overhauled version of the original RUMBA.

Rumba3D-Splink combines the improved RUMBA+ design with a powerful 32-bit ESP32-WROOVER-IE microcontroller module added for more features.
